# Welcome to Project 00 #

Here you will begin your journey with C. This project is a simple Hello World
just to get you familar with how the rest of the projects should look and feel.

## The Files ##
Each project will have a set of files pre-populated. Most of the files will be
stuff for compilation, test, and verification of your solution to the problem;
but all will have the following three files:

* README.md - the problem statement
* makefile  - stuff to compile your code, no need to worry about it.
* test.awk  - a script to help verify your solution. no need to worry about it.
* main.c    - starter portion of code. Use it if you want to, or make your own.

## Building the project ##
In order to build this project, and subsequent projects (unless specifically
stated in the README) would be to issue the following command in the same
directory as the `makefile` for the project.

```
make all
```

If it does not build, chances are that there is something wrong with your
solution. Debug your solution before reaching out. 


## Testing the project ##
Each project comes with a small test script that will help to verify that your
solution fulfills the requirements of the problem statment. These tests are not
perfect and if you feel that your solution is correct, send me a message and I
can adjust. Nevertheless, in order to execute the tests, you can simply run the
following command:

```
make test
```

You should see a brief print out of your program complete with a "SUCCESS" or
"FAILURE" at the end.
