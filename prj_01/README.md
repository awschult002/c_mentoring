# Welcome to Project 01 #

## The Problem ##
Given a list of integer numbers, separated by spaces, provide the user with an
interface to check if a given number resides in the list. That is, ask the user
for a number, tell the user if that number is in the list. The list will be
provided on the command line as arguments to the program invocation.

```
./solution 3 5 23 42 7 6 25 8
```
